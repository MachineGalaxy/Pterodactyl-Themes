## How do i use them?
Copy the public folder into /var/www/pterodactyl/
and the resources folder into /var/wwww/pterodactyl/
After creating your theme and uploading those theme files correctly, you need to edit your .env (environment) file next. Open up your .env file and locate APP_THEME=pterodactyl line and change it to APP_THEME=Titan (case-sensitive) and save it.
